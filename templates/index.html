                    BlueButton 2.0 provides you, our Medicare Beneficiaries,
                    with the ability to access your Medicare information with
                    greater flexibility and enhanced security.

                <p>
                    Some of the new features include:
                    <li>
                        An advanced interface that provides the ability to
                        search your claims information. You no longer have
                        to download a large file of claims information and
                        manually sift through it to find the information
                        you need.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose to use your mobile phone to receive a
                        temporary pin code that you enter as part of your
                        account login.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add your own secret questions and answers that we
                        can use as login challenges when we detect that
                        your account is being accessed from a new
                        location or device.
                    </li>
                </p>
